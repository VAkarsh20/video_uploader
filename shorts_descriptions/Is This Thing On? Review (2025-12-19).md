Is This Thing On? is a Live-Action Bojack Horseman 🐴 | Is This Thing On? Spoiler-Free Review

If you miss Bojack Horseman, this is the closest thing we’re getting to a live-action version. Loosely inspired by the life of comedian John Bishop, Bradley Cooper's newest film follows Will Arnett as a father getting into the New York stand-up comedy scene to process his divorce from Laura Dern.

The cinematography puts you right in the front row of the comedy routines, making the sets feel less like jokes and more like a therapeutic outlet. It is a raw, unique, and well-made dramedy perfect for the holiday season.
