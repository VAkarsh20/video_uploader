No Other Choice is the Best International Film of the Year 🇰🇷 | No Other Choice Spoiler-Free Review

From the director of Oldboy and Decision to Leave, Park Chan-wook's newest film follows a father (played by Lee Byung-hun) who struggles to find a job after being laid off, leaving him with No Other Choice but to eliminate the competition. And yes, I mean eliminate.

It is a unique blend of dark humor and social commentary that forces you to empathize with a man doing the unthinkable to provide for his family. The Academy has no choice but to finally give Park Chan-wook the recognition he deserves.️
