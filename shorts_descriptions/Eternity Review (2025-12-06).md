Eternity is a MUST-SEE Rom-Com this Holiday Season 🎄| Eternity Spoiler-Free Review

Elizabeth Olsen stars as a woman who tragically passes and faces an impossible choice: spend eternity with her first love (Callum Turner) or her husband of 50 years (Miles Teller). 💍

Sure, it’s a little cliché and the ending is formulaic, but that’s exactly what makes it work. It’s cute, genuinely funny, and the type of feel-good movie that just doesn't get made anymore. See why in my full review of A24's newest film!

The big question: Who would YOU choose in this situation? Let me know in the comments! 👇
