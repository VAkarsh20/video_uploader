1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,066
No Other Choice is hands down the best international film of the year

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,233
here's why you have to watch it

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:08,266
from the South Korean auteur gave us Oldboy and Decision to Leave

4
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:09,633
Park Chan-wook's newest film

5
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,433
follows a father who has trouble finding a job

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,033
after being laid off from the paper industry

7
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,866
which leaves him No Other Choice but to eliminate the competition

8
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,200
and when I mean eliminate

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,133
I mean

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,866
eliminate

11
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,366
what I love about this movie

12
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,800
because this movie is a unique blend of dark humor

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,733
and social commentary

14
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,066
since Park Chan-wook is very intentional with his use of goofy comedy

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,300
as it helps emphasize the movie's profound themes

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,900
about the brutal struggles of unemployment

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,766
and the lengths we'll go to provide for our family

18
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,166
in such a hyper competitive world

19
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,833
and these messages are anchored through Lee Byung-hun's performance

20
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,100
who really takes control of the story with his own hands

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,600
it makes you empathize with a man who's doing unthinkable things

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,133
to escape unemployment and financially support his family

23
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,800
this movie is so good

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,933
that the Academy will have No Other Choice but to nominate this movie

25
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,200
and have No Other Choice

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,900
but to give Park Chan-wook the recognition he finally deserves

27
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,300
are you gonna watch it let me know your thoughts down below

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,066
because I give No Other Choice

29
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:02,866
a 9 / 10

30
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,666
which means
